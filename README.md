## Bracken

Bracken[^1] (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance with KrakEN) is a highly accurate
statistical method that computes the abundance of species in DNA sequences from
a metagenomics sample. Braken uses the taxonomy labels assigned by Kraken, a
highly accurate metagenomics classification algorithm, to estimate the number
of reads originating from each species present in a sample.
